# Ace
### An educational Webserver for Elixir.

## The plan.

1. To take this obviously deficient TCP echo server that I wrote as a beginner elixir developer and create a fully fledged HTTP server.
2. Keep reasonable notes of progress so others can learn about how to build a web server in elixir.
3. See what progress I have made in a year as an elixir developer.
